A girl named Goldilocks is travelling through a forest. She finds a house with no one inside and goes inside. She finds some food in three different bowls. She finds many things in groups of three. 
The girl was hungry and wanted to eat the food in the three bowls. The first bowl was too big and cold, the second one was too hot, but the third one was perfect. She ate and went to sit down on chairs. 
The chairs were also 3.
